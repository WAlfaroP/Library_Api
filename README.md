# Instructions to Run the Application


## Backend Project (BE)

Open and run the solution of the 'Library_WebApi' project.


## Port Comparison

- The 'Library_WebApi' Application is configured to run on port 44395.

## Changing Ports

- Change 'Library_WebApi' Application Port (BE):
 
   Find the .env file in the Library_Page Repository (FE).
   Modify the port in the variable named REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL.

**Remember, it's not recommended to commit environment variables like .env to version control due to security reasons. However, for this exercise, I've made an exception and included it.**
